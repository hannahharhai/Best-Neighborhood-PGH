## Abstract
This is our final project for CMPINF 0010.  We will be determining what the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is. The metrics we have decided to use are the number of arrests in a neighborhood, the amount of traffic, and the number of public art in various Pittsburgh neighborhoods.

## Conclusions

### Conclusion 1: Arrests
   Upon seeing my results I was suprised. To me my dataset seems flawed or at least incomplete. I would assume that the graph would stay near a consistent mark but this one increases and decreases. It makes sens that 2021 would have less reports than the rest because the year just started. The collection of data could have started during 2016 explaining the low numbers then aswell. There are also some outliers from before 2016 with less than 5 inputs. It makes sense that the Central Business District would get the most arrests because its downtown. I would not have guessed that Mt. Oliver would have the least though. But there are multiple seprate categories for Mt. Oliver(Neighborhood, Boro, and Mount oliver which has 100) Making Troy Hill-Herrs Island the new number one.
    
### Conclusion 2: Art
   When considering the number of art projects in each neighborhood, the “best” one is the Central Business District clocking in with 27 various art projects/attractions.  Following not far behind is Squirrel Hill South with 22 projects and Allegheny Center with 18.  Highland Park and South Side Flats rank in at the 4th and 5th spot both tied with 10 attractions each.  It’s not that surprising that these neighborhoods rank in the top 5 as they are some of the most cultural and historic neighborhoods in Pittsburgh.
    
### Conclusion 3: Traffic
   In conclusion, the "best" neighborhood by the traffic metric is Spring Hill-City View, at an average of only 63 cars passing through. This is followed with a 52 car gap by South Side Flats at 115. Coming in 3rd, is Lincoln Place. Surprisingly, one of the entries with an average of zero was Pitt campus' Oakland. I would have expected this to be one of the worst, as Forbes Avenue, as well as the Boulevard of the Allies runs through it, however the creators of the dataset may not have measured it. It doesn't, however, surprise me that the least driven-through neighborhoods are on the outskirts of the main city area. 
   
### Final Conclusion
   Based on a data driven project we concluded that Lower Lawrenceville is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, ranking in at least the top 15 in all metrics.  Lower Lawrenceville is a smaller neighborhood in Pittsburgh that offers residents a good urban/suburban mix environment.  There's plenty of shops, restaurants, bars, and parks.  Overall, Lower Lawrencville has lower crime rates than a lot of other areas in the city, has a good amount of art/cultural attractions to visit, and does pretty good in terms of traffic compared to other neighborhoods.  In conclusion, Lower Lawrenceville seems like it would be a perfect place for families and younger adults to live, and is easily one of the best and in our opinion based on our data the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
